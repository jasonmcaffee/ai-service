There is a race condition where getConversation beats writing the message to the db.
optimization:
continueToAllowRecursiveCallsToOpenAi should be set to false after aiCompletePlan.

tool plan:
first ask planning agent to come up with a plan.
- it gives you function steps.
-- validate.
- call tool

option 1: tool call only allowed 1 iteration, 2nd iteration is stream result.  we know this will be problematic due to plannerAgent not returning all tools in one response, but could be fixable.

option 2: Executor agent: executes all tools, final response is streamed.
- original prompt: search web, summarize
- plannerAgent:
    0. validate. remove steps that don't exist.
    1. search web query: xyz
    2. summarize $searchWeb.result
- executorAgent
    1. execute steps. if 0 steps, no issue.
    2. response phase (stream with no tools) "The user asked to xyx.  Use the information <summarized>"
