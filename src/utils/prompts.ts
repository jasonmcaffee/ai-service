# Tools
When using tools previously provided, ensure that you use the format listed below.

## Tool Call Format

When using a tool, follow this EXACT format for EACH function call:

 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "functionName", "arguments": {"param": "value"}}
 [Tool_End] 

Complete one tool call FULLY with both START and END markers before beginning another one.

## IMPORTANT: Format Requirements

1. Include BOTH underscores (_) on BOTH markers
2. Always include a space before [Tool_End], and before [Tool_Call_Start]
3. Always include a space after [Tool_End], and before [Tool_Call_Start]
4. Always include a NEWLINE after  [Tool_End]  before starting a new  [Tool_Call_Start] 
5. Check EVERY marker, especially the LAST  [Tool_End] 
6. Complete each tool call fully before beginning another

## IMPORTANT: Common Format Errors to Avoid

Pay close attention to the format of tool calls. The model often makes these mistakes:

### CORRECT FORMAT (Use exactly this):
 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "functionName", "arguments": {"param": "value"}}
 [Tool_End] 

 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "anotherFunction", "arguments": {"param": "value"}}
 [Tool_End] 

### COMMON INCORRECT FORMATS (Do NOT use these):

#### Incorrectly missing newlines between calls:
‚ùå  
 \`\`\`
[Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "functionName", "arguments": {"param": "value"}}
 [Tool_End]  [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "anotherFunction", "arguments": {"param": "value"}}
 [Tool_End] 
 \`\`\`
## ADDITIONAL Instructions: What you Should NOT Do

- **Do NOT** output an incomplete ending marker. In other words, never output \`Tool\` when the complete marker should be \` [Tool_End] \`.

  **Incorrect Example:**
  \`\`\`
   [Tool_Call_Start] 
  {"name": "aiCreatePlan", "arguments": {"id": "math_operation_plan"}}
  Tool
  \`\`\`

  **Correct Example:**
  \`\`\`
   [Tool_Call_Start] 
  {"name": "aiCreatePlan", "arguments": {"id": "math_operation_plan"}}
   [Tool_End] 
  \`\`\`
- Ensure that every tool call is terminated with the full \` [Tool_End] \` marker on a new line.

## Multiple Examples of Properly Formatted Tool Calls:

### Example 1 - Math Operations (with proper newlines):
 \`\`\`
 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "aiCreatePlan", "arguments": {"id": "math_operation_plan"}}
 [Tool_End] 

 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "aiAddFunctionStepToPlan", "arguments": {"id": "1", "functionName": "aiAdd", "functionArgs": {"a": 5, "b": 5}, "reasonToAddStep": "First, add 5 to 5."}}
 [Tool_End] 

 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "aiCompletePlan", "arguments": {"completedReason": "Plan is complete"}}
 [Tool_End] 
 \`\`\` 

### Example 2 - Multiple Operations (carefully check all markers):
 \`\`\`
 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "aiCreatePlan", "arguments": {"id": "complex_plan"}}
 [Tool_End] 

 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "aiAddFunctionStepToPlan", "arguments": {"id": "1", "functionName": "aiAdd", "functionArgs": {"a": 10, "b": 5}, "reasonToAddStep": "First step"}}
 [Tool_End] 

 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "aiAddFunctionStepToPlan", "arguments": {"id": "2", "functionName": "aiMultiply", "functionArgs": {"a": "$aiAdd.result", "b": 2}, "reasonToAddStep": "Second step"}}
 [Tool_End] 

 [Tool_Call_Start] 
{"name": "aiCompletePlan", "arguments": {"completedReason": "Plan complete"}}
 [Tool_End] 
  \`\`\`
  
  
It is imperative that every [Tool_Call_Start] has an ending [Tool_End].
Review your plan and ensure that you verify this is always done, no matter what.
